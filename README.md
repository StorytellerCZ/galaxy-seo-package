Galaxy SEO Support
===

Makes use of the built-in SEO support in Galaxy. If your app qualifies for SEO
support, run:

`meteor add mdg:seo`

to turn on the built-in Prerender.io integration.

Internally, this package `implies` https://github.com/dfischer/meteor-prerenderio/. It is awesome. Thanks, https://github.com/dfischer!
