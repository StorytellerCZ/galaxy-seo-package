Galaxy SEO Support
===

Makes use of the built-in SEO support in Galaxy. If your app qualifies for SEO
support, run:

`meteor add mdg:seo`

to turn on the built-in Prerender.io integration.

Internally, this package `implies` [dferber:prerender](https://github.com/dferber90/meteor-prerender/), the SEO package recommended by the [Meteor Guide](http://guide.meteor.com/deployment.html#seo).
